It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Go is a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of Algol and C, with garbage collection, limited structural typing, memory safety features, and CSP-style concurrent programming features added.
More and more developers are interested in learning Go. It was the language of the year on TIOBE in 2016 and is at the top of the list of languages that developers want to learn next. 
This course will teach you how to program in Go, building on your existing knowledge of programming languages. It starts by introducing familiar features before moving on to the more unique features that have earned Go its reputation as the language of the cloud. You will learn how to build a completely functional application server in under two dozen lines of code. Then, you'll master structuring and organizing your code, implementing the procedural control structures of every C-inspired language, and breaking your code into separate functions. 
Towards the end of the course, you'll learn how to create your own packages and import them. You'll also explore Go's approach to error handling, Object-Oriented Programming, and concurrency. By the end of the course, you'll be ready to start writing your own Go projects.
